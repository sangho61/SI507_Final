SI507 Final Project Proposal
Sangho Eum

1. Project Overview
I built a program displaying the popularity of some video games by displaying Youtube information. I will collect data (from Youtube search API and video API) such as view counts, the number of postings, like/dislike comments, the number of tags and analyze them with visualization.   	

2. Presentation Options and tools
Users will be allowed to select specific period and a video game title such as Overwatch, Diablo, League of Legends, etc. After selecting, my program will output some graphs as below.
(1) The total number of view counts from Youtube for the selected game from recent 50 videos (bar chart)
(2) The ratio of like/dislike counts from Youtube (recent 50 posts per game) for the selected game (pie chart)   
(3) The average number of likes and comments from Youtube (recent 50 posts per game) for selected games (grouped bar_chart)
(4) The average number of comments from Youtube (recent 50 posts per game) for selected games (rotated bar)
